# 2023.05.29-MLI-Areas
Dory is frantically searching the Marine Life Institute for her family, but she doesn't know where to begin. Hank suggests that she first determines the number of different areas that could be searched and the boundaries.

Dory discovers a map of the MLI on grid paper. Each spot on the grid is labeled with a number. Adjacent cells (cells that share a side - not diagonal) with the same number are considered to be in the same region.

Help Dory find the number of areas in the MLI!
